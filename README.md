# Santander-Profits-Up-13-after-Mortgage-Lending-Rises
<p>
High street banking group Santander has posted a 13% rise in profits after it successfully managed to attract more current account customers. 
The Spanish-owned lender said that UK pre-tax profits increased to over £500 million in the first quarter of 2016, up from £470 million from the previous year.
It increased mortgage lending by over £1bn in the same quarter, which compares with a fall of £400m a year previously.
The 1,2,3 current account made over 100,000 new customers in the first quarter, with current account balances up £3.6bn to £56.8bn, giving it a strong advantage over its competitors.
First quarter figures were boosted by the absence of any further compensation charges for the <a hhref="http://www.ppirefund.co.uk/">payment protection insurance</a> (PPI) scandal, while it also saw a sharp fall in the number of loans turned sour, with fewer borrowers falling behind on repayments.
But owner Banco Santander - the biggest bank in the eurozone - suffered a more difficult first quarter as group-wide net profit fell 5% to 1.63 billion euros (£1.26 billion) in the first quarter.
